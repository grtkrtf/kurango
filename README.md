## Kuraŋo ##
WIP constructed language by Garret Kurteff

### Getting Started ###
Most of the important stuff about Kuraŋo can be found in `kurango/book/kurango.pdf`. Everything else in this repo is either for developing the conlang or old (probably obsolete) notes.

#### `kurango/flex` ####
A Fieldworks Language Explorer database containing interlinearizations of Kuraŋo. (http://software.sil.org/fieldworks/download/)

#### `kurango/font` ####
A custom Kuraŋo font mapped onto Japanese (as they are both CV languages, it seemed like the best way to do it).

#### `kurango/notes` ####
Old and unsorted notes I took while developing Kuraŋo.

#### `kurango/pydict` ####
This was supposed to be an interactive dictionary ran in a Python shell but I never got around to implementing it, so it only has like three words in it.
