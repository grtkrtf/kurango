\section*{Philosophy/Design Goals}

Many conlangers try to tailor their languages to their languages' respective cultures (Dothraki), or create languages as thought experiments (Ithkuil). Because I am both an academically-trained linguist and an amateur conlanger, I did neither.

% typologically optimal
% lang for linguists

% DESIGN GOALS
	% no portmanteau morphemes
	% Permutable phonetic system
	% No redundancy
	% VPiSH
	% Permutable orthography
	% Emotion expression
% Maybe move design goals to beginning of each chapter?
	% yeah do this............ but also mention in the intro or osme shit?
	% DO you even need an intro?
